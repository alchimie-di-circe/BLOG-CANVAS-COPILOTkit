description: Search and fetch CopilotKit documentation using VIBE CODING MCP
---

You have access to the **CopilotKit VIBE CODING MCP** server which provides real-time access to official CopilotKit documentation.

## Your Task

Ask the user what CopilotKit topic they want to learn about or search for. Then:

1. **Use the MCP tools** to search/fetch the relevant documentation
2. **Summarize the key points** from the documentation
3. **Provide code examples** if available
4. **Explain how it applies** to the current project (if relevant)

## Common Topics

- CoAgents and human-in-the-loop patterns
- React hooks (useCopilotAction, useCoAgent, useCoAgentStateRender, etc.)
- Backend integration (Python SDK, LangGraph integration)
- State management and synchronization
- Streaming content patterns
- AG-UI integration
- Tool creation and binding
- Deployment strategies
- Version migration guides

## Example Workflow

1. User asks: "How do I use useCoAgentStateRender?"
2. You use MCP to fetch official docs for that hook
3. You provide:
   - Purpose and use case
   - API signature
   - Working code example
   - Integration with this project
   - Common pitfalls

## Tips

- Always fetch the latest documentation via MCP
- Provide complete, working examples
- Explain the "why" behind the pattern
- Reference existing code in this project when applicable
- Mention version-specific considerations
